### **ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Setting Up a Message Queue**

âœ… **Install a Message Queue**:
-   Install RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Redis Pub/Sub.
-   Configure the message queue.

âœ… **Create Queues/Topics**:
-   Create queues or topics for different types of messages.
-   Set up routing keys or topic filters.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Implementing a Producer**

âœ… **Create a Producer**:
-   Write a producer application to send messages to the queue.
-   Use the appropriate client library for your message queue.

âœ… **Send Messages**:
-   Send messages with different formats (e.g., JSON, XML).
-   Include metadata in the messages.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Implementing a Consumer**

âœ… **Create a Consumer**:
-   Write a consumer application to receive messages from the queue.
-   Use the appropriate client library for your message queue.

âœ… **Receive Messages**:
-   Receive messages from the queue.
-   Process the messages and perform the necessary actions.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Handling Message Failures**

âœ… **Implement Error Handling**:
-   Implement error handling in the consumer application.
-   Handle message processing failures gracefully.

âœ… **Implement Retry Mechanisms**:
-   Implement retry mechanisms to reprocess failed messages.
-   Use dead-letter queues to store messages that cannot be processed.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Ensuring Message Delivery**

âœ… **Use Acknowledgments**:
-   Use acknowledgments to ensure message delivery.
-   Acknowledge messages after they have been successfully processed.

âœ… **Handle Unacknowledged Messages**:
-   Handle unacknowledged messages and re-queue them.
-   Implement message persistence to prevent data loss.

## Common Interview Questions:

-   What is a message queue and how does it work?
-   What are the benefits of using message queues?
-   How do you handle message failures and ensure message delivery?
-   When would you choose RabbitMQ over Kafka, or vice versa?

## Practical Exercises:

-   Set up a RabbitMQ or Kafka instance.
-   Implement a producer and consumer application.
-   Simulate message failures and implement retry mechanisms.
