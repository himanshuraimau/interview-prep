### **Section 13: Improving Our Codebase with MVC Architecture â€“ Task-Based Learning**

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Understanding MVC Architecture**

âœ… **Explain MVC**:
- Describe the roles of Model, View, and Controller in the MVC architecture.
- Provide examples of how each component handles different aspects of a web application.

âœ… **Benefits of MVC**:
- Discuss the benefits of using MVC, such as code organization, reusability, and maintainability.
- Compare MVC with other architectural patterns.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Implementing MVC in Our Project**

âœ… **Refactor Existing Project**:
- Choose a previous project (e.g., the file storage app from Section 11).
- Refactor the project to follow the MVC architecture.

âœ… **Create Model, View, and Controller Directories**:
- Organize the project structure into `models`, `views`, and `controllers` directories.
- Move relevant code into these directories.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Building Models**

âœ… **Define Models**:
- Create models for different data entities (e.g., User, File).
- Implement methods for data validation and database interaction.

âœ… **Implement Data Logic**:
- Move data-related logic from controllers to models.
- Use Mongoose (from Section 12) to interact with MongoDB.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Creating Views**

âœ… **Set up a Templating Engine**:
- Choose a templating engine (e.g., EJS, Pug, Handlebars).
- Configure Express to use the chosen templating engine.

âœ… **Create Views**:
- Create views for different pages (e.g., home page, file list, upload form).
- Use the templating engine to render dynamic data in the views.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Implementing Controllers**

âœ… **Create Controllers**:
- Create controllers to handle user requests and coordinate between models and views.
- Implement methods for handling different routes (e.g., `index`, `create`, `update`, `delete`).

âœ… **Handle User Input**:
- Process user input in controllers.
- Validate data and interact with models to perform CRUD operations.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 6: Routing and Middleware**

âœ… **Configure Routes**:
- Set up routes to map URLs to controller methods.
- Use Express Router to organize routes.

âœ… **Implement Middleware**:
- Use middleware for authentication, authorization, and logging.
- Apply middleware to specific routes or controllers.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 7: Server-Side Rendering**

âœ… **Implement Server-Side Rendering**:
- Render views on the server and send the complete HTML to the client.
- Use data from models to populate the views.

âœ… **Create a Custom Rendering Solution**:
- Implement your own server-side rendering solution without using a templating engine.
- Understand the basics of rendering HTML dynamically.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 8: Testing MVC Application**

âœ… **Write Unit Tests**:
- Write unit tests for models and controllers.
- Use testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai.

âœ… **Test Routes**:
- Test different routes and ensure they return the correct responses.
- Use tools like Supertest to test HTTP endpoints.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 9: Advanced MVC Features**

âœ… **Implement RESTful APIs**:
- Design RESTful APIs using the MVC architecture.
- Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes.

âœ… **Handle Asynchronous Operations**:
- Use async/await to handle asynchronous operations in models and controllers.
- Implement error handling for asynchronous code.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 10: Deployment and Maintenance**

âœ… **Deploy MVC Application**:
- Deploy the MVC application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
- Configure environment variables and deployment settings.

âœ… **Maintain Codebase**:
- Follow best practices for code maintenance and updates.
- Use version control (Git) to manage changes.
