## Common Interview Questions:

-   What are the key principles of microservices?
-   How do you handle inter-service communication?
-   What are the challenges of data management in a microservices architecture?
-   How do you deploy and manage microservices?

## Practical Exercises:

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Designing a Microservices Architecture**

âœ… **Identify Services**:
-   Choose a simple application (e.g., an e-commerce platform).
-   Identify the core services (e.g., product catalog, user management, order processing).

âœ… **Define APIs**:
-   Define the APIs for each service.
-   Use REST or gRPC for inter-service communication.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Implementing an API Gateway**

âœ… **Set Up an API Gateway**:
-   Use Express.js and a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to create an API gateway.
-   Configure the gateway to route requests to the appropriate services.

âœ… **Implement Request Routing**:
-   Route requests based on the URL path.
-   Handle authentication and authorization at the gateway.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Setting Up Service Discovery**

âœ… **Choose a Service Discovery Tool**:
-   Use Consul, etcd, or Kubernetes DNS for service discovery.
-   Set up a service registry.

âœ… **Register Services**:
-   Register each service with the service registry.
-   Implement health checks to monitor service availability.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Implementing Inter-Service Communication**

âœ… **Use REST or gRPC**:
-   Implement inter-service communication using REST or gRPC.
-   Choose a communication pattern (e.g., synchronous or asynchronous).

âœ… **Handle Data Consistency**:
-   Implement eventual consistency using events or message queues.
-   Use the Saga pattern for distributed transactions.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Deploying Microservices**

âœ… **Containerize Services**:
-   Use Docker to containerize each service.
-   Create Dockerfiles for each service.

âœ… **Orchestrate Services**:
-   Use Kubernetes to orchestrate the services.
-   Deploy the services to a Kubernetes cluster.
