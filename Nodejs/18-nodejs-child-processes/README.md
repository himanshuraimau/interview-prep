### **Section 18: Working with Child Processes in Node.js â€“ Task-Based Learning**

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Introduction to Child Processes**

âœ… **Explain Child Processes**:
- Describe what child processes are and why they are useful in Node.js.
- Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution of child processes.

âœ… **Creating Child Processes**:
- Create a simple child process using `child_process.spawn()` to execute a system command (e.g., `ls` or `dir`).
- Capture and print the output of the child process to the console.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Using `spawn()` and `exec()`**

âœ… **Using `child_process.spawn()`**:
- Use `child_process.spawn()` to execute a command with arguments.
- Pass arguments to the child process and observe the output.

âœ… **Using `child_process.exec()`**:
- Use `child_process.exec()` to execute a command and capture its output.
- Compare the behavior of `exec()` with `spawn()`.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Key Differences and Use Cases**

âœ… **Compare `spawn()` and `exec()`**:
- Explain the key differences between `child_process.spawn()` and `child_process.exec()`.
- Discuss the use cases for each method (e.g., streaming data vs. capturing output).

âœ… **Implement Use Cases**:
- Implement a scenario where `spawn()` is more appropriate (e.g., processing large files).
- Implement a scenario where `exec()` is more appropriate (e.g., running a simple command and capturing its output).

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Communication Between Parent and Child Processes**

âœ… **Sending and Receiving Messages**:
- Establish communication between a parent and child process using `process.send()` and `process.on('message')`.
- Send messages from the parent to the child and vice versa.

âœ… **Handling Standard Input/Output**:
- Use `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` to communicate with a child process.
- Send data to the child process via `stdin` and read data from the child process via `stdout` and `stderr`.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Handling Errors and Exits**

âœ… **Managing Errors**:
- Implement error handling in child processes.
- Listen for the `error` event and handle errors appropriately.

âœ… **Handling Process Exits**:
- Implement handling for process exits.
- Listen for the `exit` event and handle process exits gracefully.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 6: Implementing Retries and Handling Process Exits**

âœ… **Implementing Retries**:
- Implement a retry mechanism for child processes that fail.
- Automatically restart the child process if it exits with an error code.

âœ… **Handling Process Exits**:
- Implement handling for process exits.
- Listen for the `close` event and handle process exits gracefully.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 7: Real-World Use Cases**

âœ… **CPU-Intensive Tasks**:
- Use child processes to offload CPU-intensive tasks from the main thread.
- Implement a scenario where a child process performs a computationally expensive operation.

âœ… **Parallel Processing**:
- Use multiple child processes to perform parallel processing.
- Implement a scenario where multiple child processes work together to solve a problem.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 8: Advanced Topics**

âœ… **Detached Processes**:
- Create detached child processes that continue to run even after the parent process exits.
- Use the `detached` option in `child_process.spawn()` to create detached processes.

âœ… **Process Groups**:
- Create process groups to manage multiple child processes as a single unit.
- Use the `setsid` option in `child_process.spawn()` to create process groups.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 9: Security Considerations**

âœ… **Security Risks**:
- Discuss the security risks associated with using child processes.
- Explain how to prevent command injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

âœ… **Input Validation**:
- Implement input validation to ensure that user input is safe to pass to child processes.
- Avoid using user input directly in commands executed by child processes.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 10: Monitoring and Logging**

âœ… **Monitoring Child Processes**:
- Implement monitoring to track the performance and health of child processes.
- Use tools like `ps` and `top` to monitor child processes.

âœ… **Logging**:
- Implement logging to record the activity of child processes.
- Use a logging library like `winston` or `bunyan` to manage logs.
