---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Creating a WebSocket Server**

âœ… **Setting Up a Basic WebSocket Server**:
- Set up a basic WebSocket server in Node.js using the `ws` module.
- Implement a mechanism for handling client connections.

âœ… **Handling Client Connections and Messages**:
- Implement a mechanism for handling client connections and messages.
- Use the `on('connection')` event to handle new connections.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Working with WebSocket Clients**

âœ… **Creating a WebSocket Client**:
- Create a WebSocket client in Node.js.
- Connect the client to the WebSocket server.

âœ… **Sending and Receiving Messages**:
- Implement a mechanism for sending and receiving messages between the server and client.
- Use the `send()` method to send messages and the `on('message')` event to receive messages.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Broadcasting Messages**

âœ… **Implementing Message Broadcasting**:
- Implement message broadcasting in a WebSocket server.
- Send messages to all connected clients.

âœ… **Handling Multiple Client Connections**:
- Implement a mechanism for handling multiple client connections.
- Store connected clients in an array or set.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 6: Security Risks of WebSockets**

âœ… **Understanding Security Risks**:
- Discuss the security risks associated with using WebSockets.
- Explain how to prevent common WebSocket vulnerabilities.

âœ… **Implementing Authentication**:

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 9: Advanced Topics**

âœ… **Scaling WebSockets**:
- Explore different techniques for scaling WebSocket applications.
- Use techniques like horizontal scaling and load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application.

âœ… **Load Balancing**:
- Set up a load balancer to distribute WebSocket connections across multiple servers.
- Use tools like Nginx or HAProxy to configure load balancing.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 10: Monitoring and Logging**

âœ… **Monitoring WebSocket Connections**:
- Implement monitoring to track the performance and health of WebSocket connections.
- Use tools like `Prometheus` and `Grafana` to monitor WebSocket metrics.

âœ… **Logging WebSocket Events**:
- Log WebSocket events to analyze the behavior of WebSocket connections.
- Track metrics like connection rates, message rates, and error rates.
