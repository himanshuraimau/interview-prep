## Section 6: Mastering Buffers - Task-Based Learning

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Understanding Buffer Basics**

âœ… **Create and Initialize Buffers** using different methods:
- Create using `Buffer.from()`
- Initialize using `Buffer.alloc()`
- Try unsafe allocation with `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`

âœ… **Compare Buffer Methods** and understand when to use each:
```javascript
const buf1 = Buffer.alloc(10);
const buf2 = Buffer.from('Hello');
const buf3 = Buffer.allocUnsafe(10);
```

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Working with ArrayBuffers**

âœ… **Create an ArrayBuffer** and manipulate it:
- Initialize a 16-byte ArrayBuffer
- Create different TypedArrays from it
- Write and read values using different views

âœ… **Convert Between Buffer and ArrayBuffer**:
- Convert Buffer to ArrayBuffer and vice versa
- Understand the performance implications

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Handling Binary Data**

âœ… **Read and Write Binary Files**:
- Read an image file into a Buffer
- Modify some bytes
- Write back to a new file

âœ… **Work with Signed and Unsigned Values**:
- Use `readInt8()` vs `readUInt8()`
- Handle negative numbers in Buffers

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Buffer Pool and Memory**

âœ… **Explore Buffer Pooling**:
- Create small Buffers (< 4KB)
- Monitor memory allocation
- Understand when pooling occurs

âœ… **Memory Management**:
- Check Buffer memory usage
- Practice proper Buffer cleanup
- Handle large Buffers efficiently

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Base64 Encoding**

âœ… **Implement Base64 Operations**:
- Convert string to Base64
- Convert Buffer to Base64
- Decode Base64 back to original data

âœ… **Build a Base64 Image Converter**:
- Read an image file
- Convert to Base64 string
- Save as Base64 in a text file

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 6: Network Buffer Handling**

âœ… **Create a Simple TCP Server**:
- Handle incoming binary data
- Concatenate multiple Buffers
- Process complete messages

âœ… **Implement a Basic Protocol**:
- Define message format
- Pack data into Buffers
- Parse received Buffers

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 7: Buffer Performance**

âœ… **Compare Performance**:
- String vs Buffer operations
- Different Buffer creation methods
- Various reading/writing approaches

âœ… **Optimize Buffer Usage**:
- Implement Buffer reuse
- Use proper Buffer sizes
- Avoid unnecessary allocations

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 8: Real-world Applications**

âœ… **Build a Simple Image Processor**:
- Read image files as Buffers
- Modify pixel data
- Save modified images

âœ… **Create a File Chunker**:
- Split large files into chunks
- Store chunks in Buffers
- Reassemble files from chunks

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 9: Buffer Security**

âœ… **Handle Buffer Security Issues**:
- Secure sensitive data in Buffers
- Clear Buffers after use
- Avoid Buffer overflow risks

âœ… **Implement Secure Practices**:
- Use `alloc()` vs `allocUnsafe()`
- Handle Buffer boundaries
- Validate Buffer inputs
