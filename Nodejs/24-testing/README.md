# Testing Node.js Applications

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Setting Up a Testing Environment**

âœ… **Install Testing Framework**:
-   Install Jest, Mocha, or Chai with npm or yarn.
-   Configure the testing environment in `package.json`.

âœ… **Create Test Files**:
-   Create a `test` directory.
-   Create initial test files for different modules.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Writing Unit Tests**

âœ… **Write Unit Tests for a Simple Function**:
-   Create a function to add two numbers.
-   Write unit tests to verify the function's correctness.

âœ… **Use Assertions**:
-   Use `expect` (Jest), `assert` (Mocha), or `should` (Chai) to write assertions.
-   Test different scenarios and edge cases.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Implementing Integration Tests**

âœ… **Set Up Integration Tests**:
-   Create a simple API endpoint using Express.js.
-   Write integration tests to verify the endpoint's behavior.

âœ… **Test API Endpoints**:
-   Send requests to the API endpoint using `supertest` or `axios`.
-   Verify the response status and data.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 4: End-to-End Testing**

âœ… **Set Up End-to-End Tests**:
-   Install Cypress or Puppeteer.
-   Create a test to simulate user login.

âœ… **Simulate User Behavior**:
-   Write a test to navigate to the login page.
-   Enter credentials and submit the form.
-   Verify that the user is redirected to the home page.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

âœ… **Write Tests Before Code**:
-   Choose a new feature to implement.
-   Write a test for the feature before writing any code.

âœ… **Implement the Feature**:
-   Write the code to make the test pass.
-   Refactor the code and tests as needed.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 6: Mocking and Stubbing**

âœ… **Isolate Units of Code**:
-   Choose a function that depends on external services.
-   Use mocking libraries to isolate the function.

âœ… **Mock Dependencies**:
-   Create mocks for the external services.
-   Write tests to verify the function's behavior with mocked dependencies.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 7: Code Coverage**

âœ… **Generate Code Coverage Reports**:
-   Configure your testing framework to generate code coverage reports.
-   Run your tests and generate the reports.

âœ… **Analyze Code Coverage**:
-   Analyze the reports to identify areas with low coverage.
-   Write additional tests to improve coverage.
