### **ðŸ”¹ Task 2: IP Addressing**

âœ… **IPv4 Addressing**:
- Configure static and dynamic IP addresses on a virtual machine.
- Use `ifconfig` or `ipconfig` to inspect IP addresses.

âœ… **Public vs. Private IPs**:
- Determine the public IP address of your network.
- Understand the benefits and drawbacks of public and private IP addresses.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 3: DNS and Domain Names**

âœ… **DNS Resolution**:
- Use `nslookup` or `dig` to query DNS records.
- Understand how DNS servers resolve domain names to IP addresses.

âœ… **Domain Name Configuration**:
- Configure a domain name to point to a public IP address.
- Set up DNS records (A, CNAME, MX) for a domain.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Port Numbers and Network Interfaces**

âœ… **Port Scanning**:
- Use `netstat` or `ss` to inspect listening ports.
- Understand the purpose of well-known, registered, and dynamic ports.

âœ… **Network Interfaces**:
- Identify and describe different network interfaces (e.g., eth0, wlan0, lo).
- Configure network interfaces using command-line tools.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Network Security**

âœ… **Firewall Configuration**:
- Set up a basic firewall using `iptables` or `ufw`.
- Configure rules to allow or block specific ports and IP addresses.

âœ… **MAC Addresses**:
- Identify MAC addresses of network devices.
- Understand the role of MAC addresses in local network communication.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 6: OSI and TCP/IP Models**

âœ… **OSI Model**:
- Describe the seven layers of the OSI model.
- Provide examples of protocols used at each layer.

âœ… **TCP/IP Model**:
- Explain the four layers of the TCP/IP model.
- Compare and contrast the OSI and TCP/IP models.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 7: TCP and UDP**

âœ… **TCP vs. UDP**:
- Implement a simple TCP server and client.
- Implement a simple UDP server and client.
- Compare the reliability and overhead of TCP and UDP.

âœ… **Wireshark Analysis**:
- Capture network traffic using Wireshark.
- Analyze TCP and UDP packets to understand their headers and behavior.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 8: Remote Access with SSH**

âœ… **SSH Setup**:
- Set up an SSH server on a virtual machine.
- Connect to the SSH server using a client.

âœ… **Public/Private Keys**:

- Configure SSH to use public key authentication.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 9: Cloud Networking with AWS**

âœ… **AWS EC2 Instance**:
- Create an EC2 instance in AWS.
- Configure security groups to allow SSH and HTTP traffic.

âœ… **AWS Cost Management**:
- Monitor AWS costs using the AWS Management Console.
- Implement cost-saving measures, such as stopping unused instances.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 10: Advanced Networking Topics**

âœ… **Network Topologies**:
- Describe different network topologies (e.g., star, bus, ring).
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of each topology.

âœ… **Network Monitoring**:
- Set up a basic network monitoring tool (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix).
- Monitor network performance and identify potential issues.
