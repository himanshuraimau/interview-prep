- Set up a server, install necessary dependencies, and configure networking.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Configuring Environment Variables**

âœ… **Using Environment Variables**:
- Configure environment variables for a Node.js application.
- Use environment variables to store sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database passwords).

âœ… **Managing Secrets**:
- Implement a strategy for managing secrets and sensitive data in a production environment.
- Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to store and retrieve secrets.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Basic Server Setup for Node.js**

âœ… **Installing Node.js and npm**:
- Install Node.js and npm on a server.
- Verify the installation by running `node --version` and `npm --version`.

âœ… **Starting and Managing Processes with PM2**:
- Use PM2 to start and manage Node.js processes.
- Configure PM2 to automatically restart the application in case of a crash.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Deploying to Cloud Platforms (AWS EC2)**

âœ… **Deploying to AWS EC2**:
- Launch an EC2 instance on AWS.
- Configure the instance with the necessary security groups and IAM roles.

âœ… **Setting Up the Application**:
- Deploy a Node.js application to the EC2 instance.
- Configure the application to run in a production environment.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Deploying to Cloud Platforms (DigitalOcean)**

âœ… **Deploying to DigitalOcean**:
- Create a Droplet on DigitalOcean.
- Configure the Droplet with the necessary settings.

âœ… **Setting Up the Application**:
- Deploy a Node.js application to the DigitalOcean Droplet.
- Configure the application to run in a production environment.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 6: Introduction to CI/CD**

âœ… **Understanding CI/CD**:
- Explain the concepts of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).
- Discuss the benefits of using CI/CD in software development.

âœ… **Basic CI/CD Pipeline Setup**:
- Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions.
- Configure the pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 7: Automating Testing**

âœ… **Automating Unit Tests**:
- Integrate automated unit tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Configure the pipeline to run unit tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

âœ… **Automating Integration Tests**:
- Integrate automated integration tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Configure the pipeline to run integration tests after the unit tests have passed.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 8: Automating Deployment**

âœ… **Automating Deployment to AWS**:
- Automate the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS EC2 using the CI/CD pipeline.
- Configure the pipeline to automatically deploy the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

âœ… **Automating Deployment to DigitalOcean**:
- Automate the deployment of a Node.js application to DigitalOcean using the CI/CD pipeline.
- Configure the pipeline to automatically deploy the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 9: Monitoring and Logging**

âœ… **Implementing Monitoring**:
- Implement monitoring to track the performance and health of the deployed application.
- Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the application.

âœ… **Centralized Logging**:
- Set up centralized logging to collect and analyze logs from the deployed application.
- Use tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to manage logs.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 10: Scaling and Load Balancing**

âœ… **Scaling the Application**:
- Scale the Node.js application to handle increased traffic.
- Use techniques like horizontal scaling and load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application.

âœ… **Load Balancing**:
- Set up a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application.
- Use tools like Nginx or HAProxy to configure load balancing.
