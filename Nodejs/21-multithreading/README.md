- Implement a mechanism for the main thread to send messages to the worker thread.

âœ… **Handling Events**:
- Implement a mechanism for the worker thread to send events to the main thread.
- Use the `on('message')` and `on('error')` events to handle messages and errors.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Sharing Memory Between Threads**

âœ… **Understanding `SharedArrayBuffer`**:
- Explain what `SharedArrayBuffer` is and how it is used to share memory between threads.
- Discuss the security considerations associated with using `SharedArrayBuffer`.

âœ… **Using `Atomics`**:
- Explain what `Atomics` are and how they are used to synchronize access to shared memory.
- Implement a scenario where `Atomics` are used to prevent race conditions.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Task 6: Managing Shared Memory**

âœ… **Managing Shared Memory**:
